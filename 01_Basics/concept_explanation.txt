TOPIC 1: THE GAUSSIAN (NORMAL) DISTRIBUTION
===================================================

1. THE "COCA-COLA FACTORY" ANALOGY
---------------------------------------------------
Imagine you are the Quality Manager at a Coca-Cola factory.
Your machine is designed to fill bottles with exactly 500ml of soda.

- The Perfect Goal (Mean): 500ml.
- The Reality: The machine vibrates. It isn't perfect.
  - Most bottles get 500.1ml or 499.9ml (Very close).
  - Some bottles get 502ml or 498ml (Small error).
  - Almost no bottles get 600ml or 100ml (Huge error).

If you measured 10 million bottles and drew a graph of their fill levels,
it would form a perfect "Bell Curve." This curve is the Gaussian Distribution.

2. MAPPING THE MATH TO REALITY
---------------------------------------------------
In our code (gaussian_simulation.py), we used these variables:

A. target_mean = 0.0
   > The "Perfect Fill Level." In AI, we usually want values centered at 0.

B. target_std = 1.0 (Standard Deviation)
   > The "Shakiness" of the machine.
   > If std is low (0.01), the machine is precise (Laser).
   > If std is high (10.0), the machine is broken (Messy).
   > 1.0 is a standard, natural spread.

C. torch.randn(10_000_000)
   > This simulates running the factory for years.
   > We instantly generated 10 million "bottles" (data points) with realistic errors.

3. WHY DOES AI NEED THIS?
---------------------------------------------------
We aren't filling bottles; we are building Digital Brains (Neural Networks).

- A Neural Network has billions of "weights" (knobs) that need tuning.
- When we start training, we can't set all knobs to 0 (the brain won't learn).
- We can't set them all to 100 (the brain will crash).
- SOLUTION: We use the Gaussian Distribution.
  We initialize the brain with random values centered at 0, with a small spread.
  This gives the AI a "healthy, balanced starting point" to begin learning.

---------------------------------------------------
Summary:
"torch.randn" is just a high-speed simulator of natural imperfections.
