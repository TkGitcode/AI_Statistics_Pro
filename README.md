# AI Statistics & Probability (GPU Accelerated)

## Overview
This repository documents my MSc journey into the mathematical foundations of AI, implemented using **PyTorch on an NVIDIA RTX 5060**.
We use GPU acceleration to simulate millions of data points to verify statistical theorems empirically.

## Topics

### 1. The Normal (Gaussian) Distribution
- **File:** `01_Basics/gaussian_simulation.py`
- **Concept:** The "Bell Curve" that describes errors and weights in AI.
- **Experiment:** Generated **10,000,000** samples on GPU.
- **Result:**
